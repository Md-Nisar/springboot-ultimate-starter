Got it âœ…
Hereâ€™s a **`README.md`-ready** RBAC documentation format that includes both explanation and the ASCII tree for your operations.

# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) URL Mapping

This document explains how **features** and **operations** are structured in the RBAC system, and how their **URLs** are resolved and inherited.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Structure

- **Feature** â†’ Top-level domain of functionality (e.g., `ANALYTICS`).
- **Operation** â†’ Specific access level or action for a feature (e.g., `DASHBOARD_ADMIN`, `DASHBOARD_USER`).
- **URL Mapping** â†’ Each operation has one or more API endpoint patterns it can access.
- **Inheritance** â†’ Child operations automatically inherit URLs from their parents.

---

## ðŸ”— URL Inheritance Rules

1. **Direct URLs**: Defined explicitly in the operation.
2. **Inherited URLs**: Collected from parent operations via `getAllUrls()` method.
3. **Merging**: Uses Java Streams (`Stream.concat`) to merge parent and child URLs, removing duplicates with `.distinct()`.

Example:
- `DASHBOARD_ADMIN` inherits `/v1/analytics/dashboards/**` from `DASHBOARD_USER`.

## ðŸŒ³ Operations URL Tree

```

â”œâ”€â”€ (Inherited) /v1/analytics/datasource/\*\*

## ðŸ›  Example `getAllUrls()` Implementation

```java
public List<String> getAllUrls() {
    return Stream.concat(
            urls.stream(),
            children.stream()
                    .flatMap(c -> c.getAllUrls().stream())
    )
    .distinct()
    .toList();
}
````

---

## ðŸ“‹ Benefits of This Structure

* **Scalable** â†’ Easily add new operations without breaking existing mappings.
* **DRY Principle** â†’ URLs defined once in the parent and reused via inheritance.
* **Clarity** â†’ ASCII tree gives a quick overview of all operations and their URLs.
* **Flexible** â†’ Works for multiple hierarchies like `Feature -> Admin, User` or deeper nesting.

If you want, I can **extend this README** to also include a table format listing:  
- **Operation Name**
- **Direct URLs**
- **Inherited URLs**  
so that your devs can quickly search and see access permissions without reading the tree. That would make it both **human-readable** and **machine-verifiable**.  

Do you want me to add that table version too?
